    \caption{Architecture of Fuzzy Attention Networks (FAN) with detailed fuzzy logic components. The system processes multimodal inputs through BERT and ResNet encoders, applies learnable fuzzy membership functions (μ₁-μ₇) with bell-shaped curves to modulate attention weights, and performs multimodal fusion for final classification. Fuzzy sets define semantic similarity, word importance, visual saliency, object boundaries, and cross-modal alignment.}
